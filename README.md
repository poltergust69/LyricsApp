# LyricsApp

An Android "to-do list" application built for my CS 441 - Mobile App Development course.
A Java Spring-Boot songs lyrics application. Every song has an Artist, belongs to an Album and can have more
than one genre. The admin user can make changes like add, edit, delete and like songs. All the users can make a
favorites list with their favorite songs.
